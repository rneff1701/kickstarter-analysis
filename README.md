# Kickstarter Analysis
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Project Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze data on campaigns ran on the website Kickstarter.  The requestor is planning on launching a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a theater production.  The bulk of the analysis focused on similar campaigns for theater related projects.

### Analysis and Challenges:
The analysis began with reviewing what was in the data set and what could be calculated from the fields provided.  The "Percentage Funded" and "Average Donation" fields were calculated using data provided.  The "Category and Subcategory" field was broken down into two fields to allow filtering at a more granular detail.  Lastly, the "Date Created" and "Date Ended" fields provided were converted into a more readable format and a field for the "Year" was created.

After all the new fields that were needed were added, separate pivot tables at the "Category" and "Subcategory" were created to filter and view the data specific to theaters and plays.  Another pivot table was created to see the relationship between launch date and project outcome.  Also, analysis on specific project was performed on plays that were showing at a film festival in Edinburgh.  

Lastly, a pivot table was created to review project outcome by the goal of the project.  Upon review of this table it was determined
